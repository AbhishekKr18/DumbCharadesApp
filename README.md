# DumbCharadesApp

This is a fun app where random movies comes and we have to act the movies name before the timer runs out.
It has two teams and each team's turn comes one after another with respective scores.
There is a timer and we have one minute to act the movies. We have the option to end the game and winner team is declared also.

It is created using Kotlin language following Android Best Architectural Patterns like MVVM and Coroutines.

I have used Retrofit Library with Moshi Converter Factory to work with API and JSON responses.

It uses TMDB's API as it's movies source. 

I have used best practices like ViewModel and LiveData in this app.
